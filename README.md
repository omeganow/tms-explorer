# TMS Explorer

TMS Explorer was developed to assist with the data preprocessing of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as part of the study "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and mindfulness meditation in fibromyalgia" in the "Non-invasive brain stimulation lab" (NBS) at the university medicine GÃ¶ttingen (UMG) under Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Andrea Antal. PhD student Perianen Ramasawmy conducted the study in 2022/2023 and the software was developed based on his requirements.

## Data Preparation
1. Open .cfs file in software Signal 1.4  
2. Go to File > Export As...
3. Choose the location to save new file
4. Change Datatype to: MATLAB data (*.mat)
5. Filename > structure: F00x_timePoint_measurement; e.g. F001_AC_LICI
6. Time points: BA (baseline); PM (post meditation training); AC (acute); LT (long term)
7. Click "save"
8. Make sure "All frames" under Frames are selected

## Import and work with .mat files in TMS Explorer

1. Open folder and browse for patients data ![Screenshot Overview](/screenshot_overview.png)
2. All frames which need to be inspected is marked as yellow: those are the ones with noisy baselines (>0.05 mV) and those without TMS pulses ![Screenshot Inspector](/screenshot_inspector.png)
3. After exclusion, the frames will be marked red.
4. Going back to the overview, all mean values has been adjusted to the current frames which hasn't been excluded.
