TMS Explorer was developed to assist with the data preprocessing of transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) as part of the study "Transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) and mindfulness meditation in fibromyalgia" in the "Non-
invasive brain stimulation lab" (NBS) at the university medicine GÃ¶ttingen (UMG) 
under Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Andrea Antal. PhD student Perianen Ramasawmy conducted 
the study in 2022/2023 and the software was developed based on his requirements.
